# WordPress Developer Toolset

wpdtoolset for short

## Main Goal

The purpose of this project is to create a toolset
to help WordPress developers quickly setup a powerful developement
environment. This project takes ideas from Varying Vagrant Vagrants
(https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) but with Docker
instead making it a more lean and versatile environment.

## Current status

The project right now is kind of just a proof of concept but its updated frequently
in hopes to be ready for production soon.

More soon...

## Building

To build a new bin/wpdtool.phar just run

```
vendor/bin/phar-builder package
```

All the settings are configured in composer.json
